      <description>In-Depth Commute Analysis: Final Project For my final project in my Computational Statistics (Math 448) class, I had to analyze a dataset. I decided to do an indepth analysis of my commute (finally). The results are below!
Introduction &amp;amp; Data Ever since coming to campus in Fall 2017, I have become obsessed with timing my commute and seeing how long it takes to go to Brookline Village to UMass Boston.

      <description>At long last, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten around to playing with the data I&amp;rsquo;ve collected all semester tracking my commute, which I promised to do pretty much the second I started this blog (see my first post). I have a pretty complex commute - I take the MBTA&amp;rsquo;s green line into Park Street and then connect to the red line, so I usually leave the house 1 hour and 15 minutes before class starts.</description>
