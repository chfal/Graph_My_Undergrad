      <title>Exploring my Google Fit Data</title>

      <description>Introduction A lot has changed as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, including the fact that we basically don&amp;rsquo;t leave our houses to see our friends, everything happens on Zoom, and we&amp;rsquo;re moving around a lot less (my summer internship has me examining large-scale mobility data changes, more on that later).
However, one of my pre-pandemic goals was to get better at working out every day and keeping in shape. In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m going to take a look at the Google fit data (collected from my smartphone, auto-tracking steps, moving/active minutes) before and after the pandemic to see what it looks like.</description>

      <title>Commute Analysis</title>

      <description>In-Depth Commute Analysis: Final Project For my final project in my Computational Statistics (Math 448) class, I had to analyze a dataset. I decided to do an indepth analysis of my commute (finally). The results are below!
Introduction &amp;amp; Data Ever since coming to campus in Fall 2017, I have become obsessed with timing my commute and seeing how long it takes to go to Brookline Village to UMass Boston. This data may have a limited scope of importance, because my own commute has little effect on others’ lives.</description>

      <title>Word Clouds: An Adventure in Text Mining (again!)</title>

      <description>Ever since I&amp;rsquo;ve started this blog, I&amp;rsquo;ve been a huge fan of text mining. And I mean literal text mining, such as this sweet sentiment analysis a man made of him and his girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s text messages. I realized that my friend and I had been chatting for over a six months everyday through Facebook Messenger, and jumped at the chance to make some fun word clouds.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to show the code I wrote to make these graphs, but a lot of it was really difficult and mostly scraped from StackOverflow and again, Julia Silge&amp;rsquo;s awesome resource on Tidytext.</description>

      <description>After some magic where I was suddenly moved up 6 spots on a wait list of 25 people, I was recently able to attend the Lightning Talks by the Tidyverse Team, hosted by R Ladies Boston and the Greater Boston UseR meetup groups! I&amp;rsquo;ve been going to R meetups since last Spring, but I really enjoy meeting new people and I was inordinately excited at the potential of meeting everyone&amp;rsquo;s favourite RStudio scientist, Hadley Wickham.</description>

      <title>Outreach, WiSTEM, and R</title>
      <link>/2019/05/08/r-outreach/</link>

      <description>In this post, I’m going to talk a little bit less about graphs and data, and more about outreach.
As a minority in STEM, I’m really interested in outreach, science commmunication, and the increase of diversity in my field. So when the STEM Ambassadors Program at UMass offered the opportunity to create an activity centered around my research interests to “pitch” my science to a group of middle schoolers, I jumped at the chance.</description>
