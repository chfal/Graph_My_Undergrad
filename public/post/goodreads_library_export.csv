Emmy felt throughout her life ""overshadowed"" by the fact that she appeared differently than the rest of her family, and her family did nothing to combat this or even ask about her feelings until she went into therapy. I'm Asian-adopted-American, and let me tell you, that's not how it works. I wouldn't say it was the family's fault, I would say it's the author's fault for not understanding how adoption works. At the Adoption Issues group Emmy attended they made her insecure about her adoption, and for some reason it was really hard for me to read, because, especially if you've grown up with your adoptive parents since you were a baby, that's not how it feels. This book might lead others to make assumptions about adopted people. I didn't feel like shining such an intense spotlight on Emmy's adoption really added to the plot at all. So you fail at trying to make diversity happen.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on her anorexia that was consistently mocked.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as other reviewers have mentioned, the racist, rape, and homophobic jokes weren't really ""jokes"" more like something people could REALLY take offense at. (I am a bisexual feminist. I took a LOT of offense at the ""jokes"" contained in this book.) I think the plot was highly unrealistic, the characters were pretty one-dimensional, and the Academy was ridiculous in its leniency and ABSOLUTE CRUELTY to all the people, who I might add are SUICIDAL, ANOREXIC, or ADDICTS.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought I was going in for a great book about (finally!) an Asian Adopted American heroine, but to be honest, this book left a lot to be desired. I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYONE EVER.",,,1,,,0,,,,,
