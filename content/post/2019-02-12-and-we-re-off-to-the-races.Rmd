Data collection has officially begun!
This morning sparked the first day of tracking commute times! This semester I have a 9 a.m. three days a week (M/W/F) and an 8 a.m. two days a week (T/R). This begs the question…why does my 8 a.m. commute seem shorter? Is it just an early-morning time warp? Is it the avoidance of the peak rush hour times, making my commute actually quite significantly shorter?

I plan on tracking this my commute all semester, so hopefully there’ll be an interesting trend in the data!
