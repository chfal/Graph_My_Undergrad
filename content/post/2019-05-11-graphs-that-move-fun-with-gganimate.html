<p>I recently learned about the <em>gganimate</em> package, which means…</p>
<div id="we-can-make-graphs-that-move" class="section level1">
<h1>We can make graphs that move!</h1>
<p>The future is now, people.</p>
<p>My first gganimate is below.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
library(gganimate)

#read in the data
gganimate_practice &lt;- read.csv(&quot;image_tracker.csv&quot;)

#this is the plot
gg_animate_plot &lt;- ggplot(gganimate_practice, aes(Day, Running_Total, color=factor(Week))) +
  geom_line(size=2) +
  labs(y=&quot;Running Total&quot;, title=&quot;Image Analyses Per Day&quot;)

#now we add the animated layer to the plot
gg_animate_plot +
  transition_reveal(Day)</code></pre>

<p>This post may have less text than the other posts…that’s because it speaks for itself. Also, it’s similar to <a href="http://graphmyundergrad.rbind.io/2019/04/15/research-progress-update-more-than-halfway-there/">this graph</a> that I’ve made for this blog before. I just animated it because it was easy &amp; clean sample data to explore such a fun new package. That being said, I’m planning to make even more gifs in the future, so keep checking back!</p>
