<p>Hi, I’m Cleo! I'm an undergraduate biology major with an undeclared math minor, and I’m currently learning R. After using R’s data sets to run tests and create graphs, I’ve decided to start collecting my own. <br><br>On this blog, I'll collect data on a few different projects about commute times and lengths (critical to anyone who lives in the city), make progress on my independent research, and track exam scores from classes. Then, we will run analyses in R using RStudio, Tidyverse, and other associated packages.</p>

<p> This blog itself is made in R using the Blogdown package, which uses Hugo websites. The code for all the data and projects can be found on my GitHub repository if you'd like to play around with the data as well! </p>
